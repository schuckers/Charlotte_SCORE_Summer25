    "Data cleaning is an essential part of data science and sports analytics. Most of the time, you need to clean up the dataset before using it because it won't always be in a correct or readable format. This brings us to the \"three C's\". This is a very important aspect of data science that provides basic guidance on what to look for when undergoing the data cleaning process. \n",

    "_Consistent_: This means that your dataset is correctly formatted in a standardized fashion. All instances are properly formatted into their respective data types and there are no inconsistencies with test casing.\n",

    "_Complete_: There is no missing data. All missing values have been addressed by filling them with a reasonable substitute, imputation (we will discuss this later) and/or removing the data depending on the context (we will discuss the ethics of this later).\n",
