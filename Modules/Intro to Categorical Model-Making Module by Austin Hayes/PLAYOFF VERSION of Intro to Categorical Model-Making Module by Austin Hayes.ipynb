    " - Again I love these data.\n",
    " - Worried about timeliness of predicting 2025 results mid season.  I get the desire at the moment but not sure it will age well.  Let's update the data from the 2025 reason to get the full season results. - Done\n",
    " - Need to more explicitly explain what is happening with scaling and why we are doing it.  Also, we use fit_transform() on training data and tranform() on test data.  Here's why\n",
    "[< https://towardsdatascience.com/what-and-why-behind-fit-transform-vs-transform-in-scikit-learn-78f915cf96fe/>] - Done. \n",
    " - Maybe go through the 19-23 train with 24 test as an example then have 19-24 train and 25 test as an exercise.\n",
    " - Need to have some explanation of the statistics.  What is a field goal?  What is a two-point versus a three-point field goal?  (All field goals in football are 3 points)  What is a rebound?  An assist? etc. - Done.\n",
    " - When you do 'log_predictions' explain what a zero represents and what a one represents. I would also rename that variable 'logit_predictions' to make it clearer - Done.\n",
    " - logistic regression assumes a linear relationship among the log-odds of the response and the predictors - Done.\n",
    " - Comment on the numbers that go into the first accuracy score. Also note that this is training data accuracy. - Done.\n",
    " - Be clear and explicit about the results and what they mean. - Done.\n",
    " - I've rounded the predicted probabilities for some of the output to help make sense of those values. Probably should mention early on that the probabilities in each row will sum to 1. And explain why that is. - Thank you for doing that, I have added a note about sumation of 1 for each row.\n",

    "- Let's break this first markdown into a couple of cells _- Done._\n",
    "- Make sure you mention kNN methods earlier _- Done._\n",
    "- I think there are only 12 rows in these data and that is likely to lead to some overfitting. Your description says 60 rows which would be 5 years of data, I think. _- Done; I compiled 5 years of data for training the models._\n",
    "- For transforming and rescaling data, you should use the scaler for the training data and apply that same scaler to the test data. This avoids some possible information leakage from the training to the test data. _- Done._ \n",
    "- When I run the logistic I don't get any 1's. Just 0's and the probability for the first team is 0.38 of being a one. _- Done. For some reason, when creating the module it gave me a 1 but I just re-ran it and got what you did._\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also have a categorical response that is only 8% of rows can lead to some issues. Can we make the target, made the playoffs instead? The model can be 92% accurate by just saying all of the rows will be zero. _-Agreed; I have made a seperate notebook file to do this suggestion. The file is located in this module's file on the Github. The title starts with \"PLAYOFF VERSION\". I'm doing this just so we can keep this version as a backup for now._\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we begin the technical aspect of this learning module, let's go over some key statistics and what they mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Field Goal_: Any type of basket made during live basketball play. Any type of basket made outside of free throws is considered a field goal. Dunks, layups, mid-range shots and three-pointers are all examples of a field goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "_2-point shot_: A 2 point shot is any type of field goal that counts for 2 points. These shots are made from inside the 3-point line, which is the the large line painted around a basketball net on one side of a court. 2-point shots includes dunks, layups and midrange shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "_3-point shot_: A 3 point shot is the reverse of a 2-point shot. It is any shot made outside of the 3-point line. If a player steps over the line during the shot, it will count as a 2-point shot. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Rebound_: A rebound is when a player shoots the ball, misses the shot and the same or different player catches the ball after it falls down from the rim. The player who made the rebound must maintain full control of the ball and land on the ground with possesion. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Assist_: An assist is made when one player passes the ball to their teammate and that teammate makes a field goal. However, the pass must directly contribute to the field goal that was made. For example, the general rules state that an assist only counts if the teammate who recieved the ball via a pass, makes the field goal in 2 dribbles or less. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Free throw_: A free throw is a free, unguarded shot (or 2) that was award to a player via a foul commited by the other team. Usually, free throws are awarded off of shooting fouls which occur when a player attempts to score a basket but a defender on the opposing team makes illegal contact, such as a slap on the wrist while a player is making a shot attempt. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Block_: A block is made when a defender swipes an offensive players shot out of the air without making illegal contact with the player who attempted the shot. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Steal_: A steal occurs when a defensive player cleanly swipes the ball out of an offensive players hands or when a defensive player intercepts a ball off a pass between two offensive players. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Turnover_: A turnover occurs when there is a steal by the defense, a travel violation by the offense (more then two steps without dribbling the ball), an offensive player stepping out of bounds, etc."

    "\n",
    "Classification is a modeling approach to predict a non-numeric (or categorical) outcome using available data. For this module, we will be predicting a binary outcome, like 'yes' or 'no', 'Made Playoffs' or 'Did not make Playoffs', etc. There are various models that can be used to achieve this but today we will go over Logistic Regression, k Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Aanlaysis (QDA) models. Each of these models use different methodologies to achieve the same goal. Therefore, each models predictions may differ from each other, warranting comparison. This can be done using metrics that we will go over later in this lesson."

    "# Modeling Process For This Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build a model, we will need to train the model and then test the model to see how accurate it is. Normally, we would want to build the model by splitting a season's worth of data into a train dataset and a test dataset. Generally, you want to split the data into a higher proportion of training data than test data. This ensures that the model will be more adequately prepared to make predicitions on the test data. On the flip side, there needs to be a balance between your train and test sets because the more test data you have, the more data you have to test your models accuracy. Normally, we use 60-80% of the data for training the model and 20-40% for testing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will want to do something a little different in this module. For the seasons we will be training the model with, there are only 12 WNBA teams. That is not enough data! In this case, we have compiled a dataset of 'Per Game' data for every team over the last 5 seasons, before the 2024 season. 'Per Game' means that the stats are an average of each catgory among all games played. For example, the 'PTS' column is an average of each teams points scored per game. We will train our models on that compiled dataset and then test the accuracy of our models with the 2024 season data. After reviewing each model's accuracy score, we will pick the model with highest accuracy and re-train it with another compiled dataset. This other compiled dataset will include 2020-2024 data instead of 2019-2023 in order to provide the newest data to the model. After retraining the model, we will have the model predict which teams will make the WNBA playoffs in the current 2025 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The compiled dataset was built upon several 'Per Game' datasets from Basketball-Reference.com. Please visit their website using the link at the top of this module. Each teams name has been edited to identify what year each team's stats are from since there are reoccuring team names. A 'CHAMPION' column was also added in order to identify which teams won a championship. 1 = Champions, 0 = Not Champions. We will not be using this column in this lesson. Instead, we will use the 'PLAYOFFS' column since we are predicting who will make the playoffs. The 'PLAYOFFS' column was added after the fact, like the 'CHAMPION' column, and was not in the original Basketball-Reference.com dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to test the accuracy of the model(s) amongst one another, we want to train the model(s) on the previous 5 season's worth of data for higher model accuracy. We will train the model(s) using 2019-2023 season data and test it with the 2024 season data. The model with the highest accuracy, or of our choosing, will be used to predict who will make the WNBA playoffs this season using the 'Per Game' stats thus far.\n",

    "Logistic Regression is a categorical model that uses probabilities to predict a binary outcome. A Logistic Regression model outputs log odds (logit) which range from 0 to 1. 0 means a negative/ false outcome and a 1 is a positive/ true outcome. These odds are calulcated by the following equation, p / (1-p), where p is the probability of an outcome. This essentially assesses an event's probability of success to its probability of failure in the form of a ratio. This is why we will name the predictions made by a Logisitic Regression model, \"logit_predictions\", throughout this module. When a logit outcomes from a Logistic Regression model assume a linear relationship between predictors and the response vairable.\n",

Remember, these probabilities are in a scientific notation so you can indicate where they actually are beyond the decimal point by looking at the number beyond the hyphen. We can see that the model predicted the second team in the list, the New York Liberty, to have the highest probability of making the playoffs, 0.9999, for the 2024 season. For the model to predict a team as a playoff team, the probability needs to be greater than 50%.

In other words, an event cannot have a negative percent chance of happening or over 100% chance of happening. An event occurs or it does'nt; the result is binary. Since the results are binary, the two must add up to 100% because one of the possible outcomes will occur. There is an 100% certainty that one of the possbile outcomes will happen, hence their probabilites add up to one.\n",

One is called Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and the other being Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). These models essentially create a line to classify data points into a category. Discriminant Analysis does this by selecting the category with the highest value from an estimated Normal probability density from among densities fit to each category.  LDA comes from assuming that each category has the same variance and correlation among the features, while QDA allows each group/category to have a different set of variances and correlations.  We will begin with LDA first."

It is essentially deciding where to classify a data point based on the closest points or \"neighbors\". You can control the number of neighbors that a data point will be classified with by defining K. If you make the K number of neighbors too high, it may make the model too generalized and cause it to have low accuracy. Likewise, if you make K too small, it will be too niche and become inaccurate as well. \n",

    "Throughout this module, we have seen a lot of things. We have gone over the basics of modeling with KNN, LDA, QDA and Logistic models. We have discussed scaling, accuracy scores, tie-breakers, etc. There is a LOT that comes with the modeling process. There are also lots of other types of models that could have been used to find this outcome such as SVM's, Decision Trees, etc. There are plenty of other alternatives that could be used in place of the models we have learned about today. \n",
    "\n",
    "We learned that Discriminant Analysis was NOT a good idea for this dataset and that logistic models, along with KNN models, fit this project much better. This may be due to the scaling along with the variances/relationships among the predictor variables. Exploratory analysis and data validation is extremely important in the model-making process. Preparing the data for usage and discovering what works and what does'nt is a vital piece of the puzzle, as we figured out today. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the failures using Discriminant Analysis models, our Logistic models and KNN models produced consistant results among their respective predictions. After modeling the results, we will conclude that the teams making the playoffs in 2025 are the Liberty, Lynx, Sparks, Fever, Dream, Mercury, Aces, and the Storm!"
