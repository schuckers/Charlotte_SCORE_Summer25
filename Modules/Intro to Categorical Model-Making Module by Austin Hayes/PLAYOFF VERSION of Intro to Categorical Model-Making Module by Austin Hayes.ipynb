    "- Let's break this first markdown into a couple of cells _- Done._\n",
    "- Make sure you mention kNN methods earlier _- Done._\n",
    "- I think there are only 12 rows in these data and that is likely to lead to some overfitting. Your description says 60 rows which would be 5 years of data, I think. _- Done; I compiled 5 years of data for training the models._\n",
    "- For transforming and rescaling data, you should use the scaler for the training data and apply that same scaler to the test data. This avoids some possible information leakage from the training to the test data. _- Done._ \n",
    "- When I run the logistic I don't get any 1's. Just 0's and the probability for the first team is 0.38 of being a one. _- Done. For some reason, when creating the module it gave me a 1 but I just re-ran it and got what you did._\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also have a categorical response that is only 8% of rows can lead to some issues. Can we make the target, made the playoffs instead? The model can be 92% accurate by just saying all of the rows will be zero. _-Agreed; I have made a seperate notebook file to do this suggestion. The file is located in this module's file on the Github. The title starts with \"PLAYOFF VERSION\". I'm doing this just so we can keep this version as a backup for now._"

For today, we will be predicting a binary outcome, like 'yes' or 'no', 'Made Playoffs' or 'Did not make Playoffs', etc. There are various models that can be used to achieve this but today we will go over Logistic, KNN, LDA and QDA models. Each of these models use different methodologies to achieve the same goal. Therefore, each models predictions may differ from each other, warranting comparison.

    "# Modeling Process For This Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build a model, we will need to train the model and then test the model to see how accurate it is. Normally, we would want to build the model by splitting a season's worth of data into a train dataset and a test dataset. You want to split the data into a higher ratio of training data than test data. This ensures that the model will be more adequately prepared to make predicitions on the test data. On the flip side, there needs to be a balance between your train and test sets because the more test data you have, the more data you have to test your models accuracy. Normally, we use 60-70% of the data for training the model and 40-30% for testing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will want to do something a little different in this module. For the seasons we will be training the model with, there are only 12 WNBA teams. That is not enough data! In this case, we have compiled a dataset of 'Per Game' data for every team over the last 5 seasons, before the 2024 season. 'Per Game' means that the stats are an average of each catgory among all games played. For example, the 'PTS' column is an average of each teams points scored per game. We will train our models on that compiled dataset and then test the accuracy of our models with the 2024 season data. After reviewing each model's accuracy score, we will pick the model with highest accuracy and re-train it with another compiled dataset. This other compiled dataset will include 2020-2024 data instead of 2019-2023 in order to provide the newest data to the model. After retraining the model, we will have the model predict which teams will make the WNBA playoffs in the current 2025 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The compiled dataset was built upon several 'Per Game' datasets from Basketball-Reference.com. Please visit their website using the link at the top of this module. Each teams name has been edited to identify what year each team's stats are from since there are reoccuring team names. A 'CHAMPION' column was also added in order to identify which teams won a championship. 1 = Champions, 0 = Not Champions. We will not be using this column in this lesson. Instead, we will use the 'PLAYOFFS' column since we are predicting who will make the playoffs. The 'PLAYOFFS' column was added after the fact, like the 'CHAMPION' column, and was not in the original Basketball-Reference.com dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to test the accuracy of the model(s) amongst one another, we want to train the model(s) on the previous 5 season's worth of data for higher model accuracy. We will train the model(s) using 2019-2023 season data and test it with the 2024 season data. The model with the highest accuracy, or of our choosing, will be used to predict who will make the WNBA playoffs this season using the 'Per Game' stats thus far.\n",

You can control the number of neighbors that a data point will be classified with by defining K.

Likewise, if you make K too small, it will be too niche and become inaccurate as well. \n",

    "Throughout this module, we have seen a lot of things. We have gone over the basics of modeling with KNN, LDA, QDA and Logistic models. We have discussed scaling, accuracy scores, tie-breakers, etc. There is a LOT that comes with the modeling process. There are also lots of other types of models that could have been used to find this outcome such as SVM's, Decision Trees, etc. There are plenty of other alternatives that could be used in place of the models we have learned about today. \n",
    "\n",
    "We learned that Discriminant Analysis was NOT a good idea for this dataset and that logistic models, along with KNN models, fit this project much better. This may be due to the scaling along with the variances/relationships among the predictor variables. Exploratory analysis and data validation is extremely important in the model-making process. Preparing the data for usage and discovering what works and what does'nt is a vital piece of the puzzle, as we figured out today. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the failures using Discriminant Analysis models, our Logistic models and KNN models produced consistant results among their respective predictions. After modeling the results, we will conclude that the teams making the playoffs in 2025 are the Liberty, Lynx, Sparks, Fever, Dream, Mercury, Aces, and the Storm!"
