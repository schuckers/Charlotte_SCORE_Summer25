For today, we will be predicting a binary outcome, like 'yes' or 'no', 'Champion' or 'Not Champion', etc. There are various models that can be used to achieve this but today we will go over Logistic, LDA and QDA models. Each of these models use different methodologies to achieve the same goal. Therefore, each models predictions may differ from each other, warranting comparison. This can be done using certain metrics that we will go over later in this lesson."
