    "Categorical Modeling is a way of measuring/predicting a non-numeric outcome using previously available data. For today, we will be predicting a binary outcome, like 'yes' or 'no', 'Champion' or 'Not Champion', etc. There are various models that can be used to achieve this but today we will go over Logistic, LDA and QDA models. Each of these models use different methodologies to achieve the same goal. Therefore, each models predictions may differ from each other, warranting comparison. This can be done using certain metrics that we will go over later in this lesson."

    "# Modeling Process For This Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build a model, we will need to train the model and then test the model to see how accurate it is. Normally, we would want to build the model by splitting a season's worth of data into a train dataset and a test dataset. You want to split the data into a higher ratio of training data than test data. This ensures that the model will be more adequately prepared to make predicitions on the test data. On the flip side, there needs to be a balance between your train and test sets because the more test data you have, the more data you have to test your models accuracy. Normally, I use 60-70% of the data for training the model and 40-30% for testing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will want to do something a little different in this module. For the seasons we will be training the model with, there are only 12 WNBA teams. That is not enough data! In this case, I have compiled a dataset of 'Per Game' data for every team over the last 5 seasons, before the 2024 season. 'Per Game' means that the stats are an average of each catgory among all games played. For example, the 'PTS' column is an average of each teams points scored per game. We will train our models on that compiled dataset and then test the accuracy of our models with the 2024 season data. After reviewing each model's accuracy score, we will pick the model with highest accuracy and re-train it with another compiled dataset. This other compiled dataset will include 2020-2024 data instead of 2019-2023 in order to provide the newest data to the model. After retraining the model, we will have the model predict the next WNBA Champion.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The compiled dataset was built upon several 'Per Game' datasets from Basketball-Reference.com. Please visit their website using the link at the top of this module. Each teams name has been edited to identify what year each team's stats are from since there are reoccuring team names. A champion column was also added in order to identify which teams won a championship. 1 = Champions, 0 = Not Champions\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to test the accuracy of the model(s) amongst one another, we want to train the model(s) on the previous 5 season's worth of data. Since this is a special case (only one 'champion' and NOT multiple) we will train the model(s) using 2019-2023 season data and test it with the 2024 season data. The model with the highest accuracy, or of our choosing, will be used to predict who the WNBA champion will be this season using the 'Per Game' stats thus far.\n",

The model may have predicted them to be champions because their per game stats were better than some of the teams ranked above them in the data.
