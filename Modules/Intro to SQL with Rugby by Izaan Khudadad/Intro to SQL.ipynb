    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following activity, you will use data compiled by Lyle Begbie from Kaggle, which contains detailed results from international rugby union matches played between 1871 and 2022. The dataset includes match dates, home and away teams, scores, competitions, venues, countries, and flags for World Cup and neutral-site matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each observation represents a single rugby match, providing a rich source of information to explore team performances, scoring patterns, and trends over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this data, you will practice fundamental SQL skills within Python, while also learning how to perform descriptive data analysis and aggregation on real sports data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this activity you should be able to:\n",
    "1. Use SQLite to write and run basic SQL queries, including `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`.\n",
    "2. Calculate summary statistics such as averages and counts to answer questions about international rugby.\n",
    "3. Understand how to use SQL for data wrangling and exploration within a Python notebook.\n",
    "4. Begin to think about how simple data aggregations and filters can reveal meaningful insights from sports data."

    "In this module, students will explore how to use SQL to analyze international rugby match data. By writing, executing, and interpreting SQL queries on this dataset, students will practice core data science skills such as:\n",
    "- Filtering data using `WHERE` clauses to focus on subsets of interest\n",
    "- Computing summary statistics with `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions (e.g., `COUNT`, `AVG`)\n",
    "- Sorting and ranking results to identify top teams, competitions, or scoring patterns\n",
    "- Extracting insights from dates and categorical variables\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "In the provided material, students explored how to use SQL to analyze international rugby match data. By writing, running, and interpreting SQL queries on a real sports dataset, students practiced core data science skills such as:\n",
    "- Filtering data using `WHERE` clauses to focus on specific subsets\n",
    "- Computing summary statistics and aggregates with `GROUP BY` and functions like `AVG` and `COUNT`\n",
    "- Sorting and ranking data using `ORDER BY` to identify patterns and top results\n",
    "- Using date filters to explore trends over time\n",
    "- Combining Python and SQL to perform efficient data wrangling inside a notebook\n"
