    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following activity, you will use data compiled by Peter Anderson from the Nevada State Athletic Commission(NSAC) and the California State Athletic Commission(CSAC). The dataset covers professional boxing fights held between 2009 and 2017, which includes individual fighters, their opponents, fight characteristics, broadcasting networks, and fighter earnings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each observation represents a single fighter in a given bout, forming a panel structure that enables tracking of fighters over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this data, you will work on how various variables are correlated to fighter purse amount, as well as learn about how to determine the quality of a regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the activity you should be able to: \n",
    "1. Use Python to create models based on more than two predictors. \n",
    "2. Understand what Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) is in the context of multiple regression. \n",
    "3. Look at Residual plots to determine the quality of linear regression models. \n",
    "4. Use a variety of Python Libraries such as MatplotLib, Numpy, and Seaborn in creating models. \n"
